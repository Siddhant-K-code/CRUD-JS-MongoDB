# CRUD-JS-MongoDB

It is the basic Project, where i am learning about REST API, its basic working will be Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) of User Data .

You Can Use this By Following Methods:

* `Clone/ Download`
* `Run npm install`
* `Run npm start`

I uses Postman to GET, POST API and other testing.
I uses MongoDB for DataBase.
